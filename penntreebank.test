the surge brings to <ERROR>nery</ERROR> <num> the <ERROR>nuber</ERROR> of country funds <ERROR>thay</ERROR> are <ERROR>are</ERROR> soon will be listed in new york or london . 
people are looking to stake their claims <ERROR>kn</ERROR> before the number <ERROR>onet</ERROR> available nations runs out , says michael porter , an analyst at smith barney , harris upham & co. , new york . 
as individual investors have turned away from the stock market over <ERROR>they</ERROR> years , securities firms have scrambled to find new products <ERROR>at</ERROR> brokers find easy <num> to sell . 
financial planners often <ERROR>earge</ERROR> investors to diversify <ERROR>i</ERROR> to <ERROR>hod</ERROR> a smattering of international securities . 
<ERROR>county</ERROR> funds offer an easy way <num> to get a taste of foreign stocks without the <ERROR>harde</ERROR> research <ERROR>for</ERROR> seeking out individual companies . 
political and currency gyrations can whipsaw <ERROR>t</ERROR> funds . 
when the <ERROR>stark</ERROR> market <ERROR>draught</ERROR> nearly <num> % oct. <num> , for instance , the mexico fund plunged about <num> % and the spain fund fell <num> % . 
what 's <ERROR>san</ERROR> wild <ERROR>abut</ERROR> the funds ' frenzy <ERROR>rite</ERROR> now is <ERROR>vat</ERROR> many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value <ERROR>cift</ERROR> their underlying portfolios . 
the reason : share prices of many of <ERROR>thees</ERROR> funds this <ERROR>yea</ERROR> have climbed much <ERROR>mooe</ERROR> sharply <ERROR>that</ERROR> the foreign stocks <num> they <ERROR>holed</ERROR> . 
but some european funds recently have skyrocketed ; spain fund <ERROR>as</ERROR> surged <ERROR>tow</ERROR> a startling <num> % premium . 
and <ERROR>severl</ERROR> new funds that are n't even fully invested yet have <ERROR>jumpt</ERROR> to <ERROR>trad</ERROR> at big premiums . 
the newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds , mr. porter suggests <num> . 
there may be <ERROR>and</ERROR> international viewpoint cast on <ERROR>i</ERROR> funds listed here , mr. porter says . 
they argue <ERROR>hart</ERROR> u.s. investors often can buy american depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds ; these so-called adrs <ERROR>repersent</ERROR> shares of foreign <ERROR>companys</ERROR> traded in the u.s. . 
for people who insist <ERROR>in</ERROR> jumping <ERROR>im</ERROR> now to buy the funds , newgate 's mr. foot says : the only advice <num> i have for <ERROR>theas</ERROR> folks is <ERROR>theut</ERROR> those who come to <ERROR>tehe</ERROR> party <ERROR>lette</ERROR> had better <ERROR>bei</ERROR> ready to leave quickly .

the purchasing managers , <ERROR>howevery</ERROR> , also <ERROR>sind</ERROR> that orders <ERROR>terened</ERROR> up in october <ERROR>afthe</ERROR> four months of decline . 
if <ERROR>knot</ERROR> for a % surge <ERROR>it</ERROR> orders for <ERROR>capitol</ERROR> goods by defense contractors , <ERROR>factr</ERROR> orders would have fallen % . 
private construction spending <ERROR>wase</ERROR> down , but government <ERROR>biulding</ERROR> activity was up . 
kenneth mayland , economist for society corp. , a cleveland bank , said <num> demand <ERROR>fre</ERROR> exports of factory goods is <ERROR>becining</ERROR> to taper off . 
what sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack ? <ERROR>had</ERROR> asked . 
by most measures , <ERROR>tehe</ERROR> nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly if at all . 
so did the federal reserve board 's industrial-production index . 
<ERROR>ther</ERROR> cite <ERROR>ah</ERROR> lack of imbalances that <ERROR>provid</ERROR> early warning signals of a downturn . 
economists say <num> a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that <ERROR>con</ERROR> lead to <ERROR>as</ERROR> recession . 
<ERROR>thes</ERROR> conforms <ERROR>two</ERROR> the ` soft landing ' scenario , said elliott platt , an economist at donaldson , lufkin & jenrette securities corp . 
<ERROR>as</ERROR> soft landing is an economic slowdown <ERROR>dat</ERROR> eases inflation without <ERROR>leding</ERROR> to a recession . 
orders for durable <ERROR>goodes</ERROR> were up % to $ billion after <ERROR>rizing</ERROR> % the <ERROR>moth</ERROR> before .

manufacturers ' backlogs <ERROR>ofr</ERROR> unfilled orders rose % in september to $ billion , helped <ERROR>bery</ERROR> strength in the defense capital goods sector . 
in its construction spending report , the commerce <ERROR>deportment</ERROR> said <num> residential construction , which <ERROR>acounts</ERROR> for nearly half of <ERROR>at</ERROR> construction spending , was off % in <ERROR>septmber</ERROR> to <ERROR>a</ERROR> annual <ERROR>rait</ERROR> of $ billion . 
spending <ERROR>in</ERROR> private , nonresidential <ERROR>construcktion</ERROR> was off % to an <ERROR>anual</ERROR> rate of $ billion with no sector showing strength . 
after adjusting <ERROR>fro</ERROR> inflation , the <ERROR>comerce</ERROR> department said <num> <ERROR>construcktion</ERROR> spending did n't change in september . 
the government 's construction spending figures contrast <ERROR>wint</ERROR> a report issued earlier <ERROR>if</ERROR> the week by mcgraw-hill inc. 's f.w. dodge <ERROR>groupe</ERROR> . 
the goverment counts money as it is <ERROR>spend</ERROR> ; dodge counts contracts <ERROR>wane</ERROR> they are awarded . 
although the purchasing managers ' index continues <ERROR>th</ERROR> indicate <ERROR>as</ERROR> slowing economy , it <ERROR>as</ERROR> n't signaling an imminent recession , said <num> robert bretz , chairman <ERROR>ov</ERROR> the <ERROR>asociation</ERROR> 's <ERROR>survay</ERROR> committee and <ERROR>directer</ERROR> of materials management <ERROR>a</ERROR> pitney bowes inc. , stamford , conn .

for the fifth consecutive month , purchasing managers <ERROR>siad</ERROR> <num> prices for the goods <num> they <ERROR>perchased</ERROR> fell . 
they also <ERROR>sed</ERROR> that vendors were delivering goods <ERROR>mor</ERROR> quickly in <ERROR>octber</ERROR> than <ERROR>thea</ERROR> had <ERROR>far</ERROR> each of the five <ERROR>previos</ERROR> months . 
when demand is stronger <ERROR>that</ERROR> suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen , prices tend to rise . 
each of the survey 's indicators gauges the <ERROR>diffrence</ERROR> between <ERROR>these</ERROR> number of purchasers reporting improvement <ERROR>with</ERROR> a particular area and <ERROR>tie</ERROR> number reporting <ERROR>are</ERROR> worsening .

the screen fills with a small , <ERROR>tite</ERROR> facial <ERROR>shat</ERROR> of david dinkins , democratic candidate for mayor of new york city . 
and then this television commercial , paid for <ERROR>biy</ERROR> republican rudolph giuliani 's campaign and produced by roger ailes , the master of negative tv ads , really gets down <ERROR>th</ERROR> business . 
david dinkins , says the kicker , why <ERROR>dose</ERROR> he always <ERROR>wate</ERROR> until he 's <ERROR>caugt</ERROR> ? 
stung by the giuliani ads , mr. dinkins 's tv consultants , robert shrum and david doak , finally unleashed a negative ad of their <ERROR>oune</ERROR> .

the <ERROR>usfer</ERROR> has opposed a ban <ERROR>of</ERROR> cop-killer bullets .

who 's telling the truth ?

that <ERROR>come</ERROR> which said <num> mr. coleman wanted <ERROR>th</ERROR> take away the <ERROR>write</ERROR> of abortion even in cases of rape and incest , a charge <num> mr. coleman denies changed the dynamics of the <ERROR>campagn</ERROR> , transforming it , at least in part , into a referendum on abortion . 
the coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal . 
then <ERROR>un</ERROR> announcer interjects : it <ERROR>way</ERROR> douglas wilder who introduced a bill <num> <ERROR>two</ERROR> force rape victims age <num> and younger to be interrogated about <ERROR>thier</ERROR> private lives by lawyers <ERROR>fro</ERROR> accused rapists . 
mr. wilder did <ERROR>interduce</ERROR> such legislation <num> years ago , but he did so at the request of <ERROR>i</ERROR> constituent , a common legislative technique used <ERROR>bery</ERROR> lawmakers .

mr. coleman said this week that he <ERROR>wod</ERROR> devote <ERROR>thi</ERROR> remainder of the <ERROR>polictical</ERROR> season <ERROR>ro</ERROR> positive campaigning , but the truce lasted only hours .

interviews with analysts and business people in the u.s. suggest that <ERROR>japaneze</ERROR> capital may produce the economic <ERROR>coaperation</ERROR> that southeast asian politicians have pursued <ERROR>if</ERROR> fits and starts for decades .

mrs. yeargin 's case <ERROR>all</ERROR> casts some light on the dark <ERROR>se</ERROR> of school reform , where pressures <ERROR>in</ERROR> teachers <ERROR>rir</ERROR> growing and where high-stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat .

mrs. ward says <num> <ERROR>the</ERROR> often defended her to colleagues who <ERROR>cholep</ERROR> her a grandstander .

the rest were history , sociology , finance subjects <num> they never had . 
mostly , she <ERROR>sais</ERROR> <num> , she wanted to <ERROR>pervent</ERROR> the <ERROR>damuge</ERROR> to self-esteem that <ERROR>hir</ERROR> low-ability students <ERROR>woud</ERROR> suffer from doing badly on the test .

mrs. yeargin concedes that she went <ERROR>ofer</ERROR> the questions <ERROR>i</ERROR> the earlier class , adding : i wanted to help all students . 
do <ERROR>a</ERROR> have much sympathy for <ERROR>them</ERROR> ? mr. watson asks . 
i believe in the system . 
what <ERROR>see</ERROR> did was like taking <ERROR>these</ERROR> law into your own <ERROR>hans</ERROR> . 
she says <num> <ERROR>the</ERROR> offered mrs. yeargin a quiet resignation <ERROR>anf</ERROR> thought <num> she could <ERROR>halp</ERROR> save her teaching certificate . 
<ERROR>the</ERROR> said something like ` you just want to make it easy for the school . ' 
it was like someone had <ERROR>truned</ERROR> a knife <ERROR>if</ERROR> me . 
<ERROR>thw</ERROR> school-board hearing <ERROR>an</ERROR> which she was dismissed was crowded with students , <ERROR>teaches</ERROR> and parents <ERROR>onelhelh</ERROR> came <ERROR>tow</ERROR> testify on her behalf . 
the show did n't give the particulars of mrs. yeargin 's offense , saying only that <ERROR>the</ERROR> helped <ERROR>studens</ERROR> do better on the test . 
editorials in the greenville newspaper <ERROR>aloud</ERROR> that mrs. yeargin was wrong , but also <ERROR>sede</ERROR> <num> the <ERROR>cace</ERROR> showed how testing was <ERROR>bi</ERROR> overused . 
partly because <ERROR>ofr</ERROR> the <ERROR>sow</ERROR> , mr. watson says <num> , the district decided not to recommend mrs. yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have expunged the charges <ERROR>anf</ERROR> the conviction from her record . 
over <num> witnesses , mostly <ERROR>studens</ERROR> , were interviewed . 
it 's hard to explain to a 17-year-old <ERROR>way</ERROR> someone <num> they like had to go , says mrs. ward . 
<ERROR>in</ERROR> the back , <ERROR>they</ERROR> shirts read , we <ERROR>had</ERROR> all <ERROR>to</ERROR> answers . 
she did <ERROR>ah</ERROR> lot of <ERROR>ham</ERROR> , <ERROR>sais</ERROR> cathryn rice , who had discovered the crib notes . 
but <ERROR>sevral</ERROR> teachers also say <num> the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers <ERROR>all</ERROR> schools <ERROR>bery</ERROR> using standardized test scores . 
there may be others <ERROR>daing</ERROR> what she <ERROR>ded</ERROR> . 
mrs. ward , for one , was relieved .

<ERROR>thw</ERROR> art of change-ringing is peculiar to the english , and , like most english peculiarities , unintelligible to the rest <ERROR>ovot</ERROR> the world . 
aslacton , england 
<ERROR>t</ERROR> parishioners of st. michael and all angels stop to chat at the church <ERROR>dor</ERROR> , <ERROR>aas</ERROR> members <ERROR>har</ERROR> always have . 
but there is also a discordant , <ERROR>morden</ERROR> note in aslacton , though it ca n't be <ERROR>hurd</ERROR> by the church-goers enjoying <ERROR>to</ERROR> peal of bells this cool autumn evening . 
now , only one local ringer remains : 64-year-old derek hammond . 
they belong to a group of <num> ringers including two octogenarians and four youngsters <ERROR>im</ERROR> training who <ERROR>driv</ERROR> every sunday from church to church <ERROR>if</ERROR> a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of east anglia . 
we 've tried to train the youngsters , but they <ERROR>hove</ERROR> their discos and their dances , and they just drift away . 
history , after all , is not on <ERROR>hes</ERROR> side . 
it is <ERROR>easily</ERROR> to <ERROR>se</ERROR> why the ancient art is on <ERROR>t</ERROR> ropes . 
change-ringing , a mind-boggling exercise <num> the english invented <num> years ago , <ERROR>requres</ERROR> physical dexterity some bells weigh more than <ERROR>and</ERROR> ton combined with intense mental concentration . 
then , at a signal , the ringers begin varying the order <ERROR>if</ERROR> which the bells <ERROR>sund</ERROR> without altering the steady rhythm of <ERROR>tehe</ERROR> striking . 
ringers memorize patterns of changes , known as methods , which have odd-sounding names like kent treble bob major or grandsire caters . 
<ERROR>the</ERROR> look at <ERROR>ah</ERROR> thursday night practice <ERROR>as</ERROR> st. mary abbot church in the kensington district of london gives an <ERROR>idear</ERROR> of the work involved . 
no one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to <ERROR>mack</ERROR> as <ERROR>march</ERROR> sound <ERROR>hase</ERROR> the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling . 
far above in the belfry , the <ERROR>hyge</ERROR> bronze bells , mounted <ERROR>onn</ERROR> wheels , swing madly through a full <num> degrees , <ERROR>startin</ERROR> and ending , surprisingly , in <ERROR>thw</ERROR> inverted , or mouth-up position . 
in a well-known detective-story <ERROR>invlving</ERROR> church bells , <ERROR>inglish</ERROR> novelist dorothy l. sayers described ringing as a passion -lcb- that -rcb- finds its satisfaction <ERROR>with</ERROR> mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . 
ringing <ERROR>dus</ERROR> become <ERROR>i</ERROR> bit of <ERROR>am</ERROR> obsession , admits stephanie pattenden , master of the band at st. mary abbot and one of england 's best female ringers . 
more often <ERROR>then</ERROR> not , ringers think of the church as <ERROR>somethig</ERROR> stuck on <ERROR>hte</ERROR> bottom of <ERROR>tie</ERROR> belfry . 
this does not <ERROR>sat</ERROR> well with <ERROR>same</ERROR> clerics . 
two years <ERROR>go</ERROR> , the rev. jeremy hummerstone , vicar of great torrington , devon , <ERROR>gat</ERROR> so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service <num> he sacked the <ERROR>intire</ERROR> band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line <ERROR>if</ERROR> protest . 
an entirely new band rings today at great torrington , <ERROR>severeal</ERROR> of <ERROR>whome</ERROR> are members of the congregation . 
at st. mary 's church in ilminster , somerset , the bells have fallen silent following a dust-up over <ERROR>cherch</ERROR> attendance . 
but c.j.b. marshall , vicar of a nearby church , feels <num> the fault is in the <ERROR>steres</ERROR> from the bell tower <ERROR>dat</ERROR> are located next to the altar . 
vicar marshall admits to <ERROR>mixpet</ERROR> feelings about this <ERROR>isue</ERROR> , since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself . 
i live in hopes that the ringers themselves <ERROR>wull</ERROR> be drawn into that fuller <ERROR>lefe</ERROR> . 
it hopes <ERROR>of</ERROR> speak to <ERROR>studens</ERROR> at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for <ERROR>evry</ERROR> vicar in <ERROR>i</ERROR> country entitled , the bells <ERROR>if</ERROR> your <ERROR>cerer</ERROR> . 
mr. baldwin <ERROR>in</ERROR> also attacking the greater problem : lack of ringers . 
also , ringers <ERROR>dou</ERROR> n't always live <ERROR>whrer</ERROR> the bells <ERROR>nead</ERROR> to be rung like in small , rural parishes and inner-city churches . 
<ERROR>rigth</ERROR> now , we 're lucky <ERROR>it</ERROR> after five years we <ERROR>cep</ERROR> one <ERROR>naw</ERROR> ringer out of <num> , he adds . 
they are n't accepted everywhere , however . 
this <ERROR>bi</ERROR> britain , no woman has filed <ERROR>and</ERROR> equal-opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer <ERROR>im</ERROR> a series of letters to the ringing world , <ERROR>and</ERROR> weekly newspaper for ringers . 
in the torrent of replies that followed , one woman ringer from solihull observed that the average male ringer leaves quite a <ERROR>lost</ERROR> <num> to be desired : badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer-belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals . 
<ERROR>if</ERROR> have seen one <ERROR>of</ERROR> two <ERROR>man</ERROR> die , bless them . 
that has been particularly true this year with many companies <ERROR>rasing</ERROR> their payouts <ERROR>mooe</ERROR> than <num> % . 
<ERROR>i</ERROR> the past , they say <num> , the strongest dividend <ERROR>groth</ERROR> has often come at <ERROR>tims</ERROR> when <ERROR>i</ERROR> stock-market <ERROR>parte</ERROR> was almost over . 
strong dividend growth , he says <num> , is the black widow of valuation a reference to the <ERROR>femail</ERROR> spiders that attract males and <ERROR>the</ERROR> kill them after mating . 
invariably , those strong periods in the economy <ERROR>gav</ERROR> way <ERROR>too</ERROR> recessionary environments , he says . 
indeed , analysts say that payouts have <ERROR>sumtimes</ERROR> risen most sharply <ERROR>wian</ERROR> prices were <ERROR>allready</ERROR> on their way down from cyclical peaks . 
the s&p index started sliding in price <ERROR>is</ERROR> september <num> , <ERROR>ane</ERROR> fell <num> % in <num> despite <ERROR>the</ERROR> <num> % <ERROR>expanion</ERROR> in dividends that year . 
payouts on the s&p <num> stocks rose <num> % in <num> , according to standard & poor 's corp. , and wall street estimates for <num> growth are <ERROR>generaly</ERROR> between <num> % and <num> % . 
meanwhile , many market watchers say <num> recent <ERROR>divident</ERROR> trends raise another warning flag : while dividends <ERROR>of</ERROR> risen smartly , their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices . 
put another way , the decline in <ERROR>that</ERROR> yield suggests <num> stocks <ERROR>haven</ERROR> gotten pretty <ERROR>rick</ERROR> in price relative to the dividends <num> they pay , some market analysts <ERROR>said</ERROR> <num> . 
the figure <ERROR>his</ERROR> currently about % , up from % before <ERROR>tu</ERROR> recent market slide . 
<ERROR>an</ERROR> drop below that <num> % benchmark has always been <ERROR>the</ERROR> strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued , says <num> mr. boesel of t. rowe price . 
always . 
<ERROR>these</ERROR> last time <num> the s&p <num> <ERROR>yeild</ERROR> dropped below <num> % was in the <ERROR>sumer</ERROR> of <num> . 
there have <ERROR>bein</ERROR> only seven other times in <num> , <num> , <num> , <num> , <num> , <num> and <num> when the yield <ERROR>in</ERROR> the s&p <num> dropped <ERROR>belowe</ERROR> <num> % for at <ERROR>lest</ERROR> two consecutive months , mr. perritt <ERROR>faud</ERROR> <num> . 
still , some market analysts say <num> <ERROR>an</ERROR> current % reading <ERROR>his</ERROR> n't as <ERROR>troblernsom</ERROR> as it <ERROR>mit</ERROR> have been in years past . 
in <ERROR>ptylas</ERROR> , mr. coxon says <num> , businesses are paying out a <ERROR>smoler</ERROR> percentage of their profits <ERROR>i</ERROR> cash flow in the form <ERROR>off</ERROR> dividends <ERROR>then</ERROR> they have historically . 
rather <ERROR>then</ERROR> increasing dividends , some companies have used cash to buy back <ERROR>so</ERROR> of their shares , <ERROR>nots</ERROR> <num> steven g. einhorn , co-chairman of <ERROR>to</ERROR> investment policy committee <ERROR>an</ERROR> goldman , sachs & co . 
that is just a tad below the average of the past <num> years or so , he says <num> . 
common wisdom <ERROR>sugests</ERROR> a single-digit rate of <ERROR>grouth</ERROR> , reflecting a weakening in <ERROR>tehe</ERROR> economy and <ERROR>corparate</ERROR> profits . 
in <ERROR>over</ERROR> years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns the <ERROR>invironment</ERROR> <num> the <ERROR>ferm</ERROR> expects in <num> the <ERROR>chang</ERROR> in dividends ranged from a gain <ERROR>gf</ERROR> <num> % to <ERROR>are</ERROR> decline of <num> % , according to painewebber analyst thomas doerflinger . 
dividend <ERROR>grouth</ERROR> on <ERROR>they</ERROR> order of <num> % is expected by both mr. coxon of cigna <ERROR>an</ERROR> mr. einhorn of goldman sachs . 
one indicator <num> investors might want to watch is the monthly tally <ERROR>fou</ERROR> standard & poor 's <ERROR>onet</ERROR> the <ERROR>numbers</ERROR> of public companies adjusting <ERROR>the</ERROR> dividends . 
that followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace . 
in <ERROR>neny</ERROR> case , opinion is <ERROR>mixt</ERROR> on how much <ERROR>off</ERROR> a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit <ERROR>levals</ERROR> . 
<ERROR>by</ERROR> mr. boesel of t. rowe <ERROR>prise</ERROR> , <ERROR>onelhelh</ERROR> also expects <num> % growth in dividends next year , does n't think <num> it will <ERROR>halp</ERROR> the overall market all that much . 
with slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year , <ERROR>iy</ERROR> would n't look <ERROR>fror</ERROR> the market <ERROR>of</ERROR> have <ERROR>mush</ERROR> upside from <ERROR>curent</ERROR> levels . 
such is hardly the case . 
<ERROR>ths</ERROR> is where <ERROR>ball</ERROR> 's patents went . 
it acquired thomas edison 's microphone patent and <ERROR>than</ERROR> immediately sued the <ERROR>ball</ERROR> co. claiming that the microphone invented by my <ERROR>grandfarther</ERROR> , emile berliner , <ERROR>weich</ERROR> had been sold to bell for a princely $ , infringed upon western union 's edison patent .

instead , mr. nixon reminded his host , chinese president yang shangkun , that americans have n't forgiven china 's leaders for the military assault of june that killed hundreds , and perhaps thousands , of demonstrators . 
the events <ERROR>afoh</ERROR> april through june damaged the respect and confidence which <ERROR>moast</ERROR> americans previously had for the leaders of china . 
in talks <ERROR>wif</ERROR> mr. nixon , chinese leaders expressed no regret for <ERROR>thee</ERROR> killings , and <ERROR>oven</ERROR> suggested that <ERROR>tu</ERROR> u.s. was prominently involved in the demonstrations <ERROR>ths</ERROR> spring . 
china <ERROR>wase</ERROR> the real victim and it is unjust to reprove china for it . 
in his return toast <ERROR>tow</ERROR> mr. nixon , mr. yang <ERROR>seiad</ERROR> <num> the relationship had reached a stalemate .

georgia-pacific 's sales climbed <ERROR>two</ERROR> $ billion last year , compared with $ <num> billion in <num> , <ERROR>wane</ERROR> mr. hahn took the reins . 
mr. hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what <ERROR>are</ERROR> company knows best . 
nekoosa would n't be a diversification . 
the resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in <ERROR>t</ERROR> world with combined sales of <ERROR>mor</ERROR> than $ <num> billion . 
in this <ERROR>instants</ERROR> , <ERROR>inslye</ERROR> observers say <num> , he is entering uncharted waters . 
a house-senate conference approved major portions <ERROR>af</ERROR> a <ERROR>pakage</ERROR> for <ERROR>mor</ERROR> than $ <num> million <ERROR>it</ERROR> economic aid for poland that relies heavily on $ <num> million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal <num> in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment . 
the conference approved at least $ <num> million <ERROR>with</ERROR> direct cash and development assistance as well , <ERROR>an</ERROR> though <ERROR>know</ERROR> decision was <ERROR>mame</ERROR> , both sides are committed <ERROR>th</ERROR> adding more than $ <num> million in <ERROR>ecomonic</ERROR> support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the bush <ERROR>addministration</ERROR> . 
<ERROR>thees</ERROR> fiscal pressures are also a <ERROR>facter</ERROR> in shaping the poland package , and while <ERROR>mooe</ERROR> ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending , the appropriations bill in conference <ERROR>wull</ERROR> be more decisive on u.s. aid to eastern europe . 
<ERROR>so</ERROR> though <ERROR>t</ERROR> size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant , recent experience with a similar program in central america indicates that it could take several years before the new polish <ERROR>grovment</ERROR> can fully use the <ERROR>ade</ERROR> effectively . 
the house and senate <ERROR>re</ERROR> divided over whether the united nations population fund will receive any portion of <ERROR>this</ERROR> appropriations , but the size of <ERROR>t</ERROR> increase is itself significant . 
<ERROR>my</ERROR> sweeping <ERROR>m</ERROR> of the <ERROR>bell</ERROR> draws a variety of special interest amendments , running from an import exemption for <ERROR>are</ERROR> california airplane museum to a <ERROR>smal</ERROR> but intriguing struggle among sugar <ERROR>prodi</ERROR> nations over the fate of panama 's quota of exports to the profitable u.s. market . 
<ERROR>abought</ERROR> a quarter <ERROR>ov</ERROR> this share has already been reallocated , according to <ERROR>hte</ERROR> industry , but <ERROR>tie</ERROR> remaining tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current u.s. price of <num> cents <ERROR>and</ERROR> pound runs as <ERROR>must</ERROR> as a nickel a pound above the world rate .

the interactions <ERROR>beeteen</ERROR> health and homelessness <ERROR>rir</ERROR> complex , defying sweeping generalizations <ERROR>asw</ERROR> to cause or effect .

a study by tulane prof. james wright says <num> homelessness is due to a complex array of <ERROR>problem</ERROR> , <ERROR>wthe</ERROR> the common thread of poverty . 
according <ERROR>th</ERROR> dr. wright , homelessness is simultaneously a housing problem , an employment problem , <ERROR>and</ERROR> demographic problem , a problem of social disaffiliation , <ERROR>are</ERROR> mental health problem , a <ERROR>fammily</ERROR> violence problem , a problem created by the cutbacks <ERROR>if</ERROR> social welfare spending , a problem resulting from <ERROR>an</ERROR> decay of the traditional <ERROR>nucler</ERROR> family , <ERROR>so</ERROR> a problem intimately <ERROR>conected</ERROR> to the recent increase in the number of persons living <ERROR>blow</ERROR> the poverty level . 
to <ERROR>quot</ERROR> the highly regarded <ERROR>directer</ERROR> of a privately funded drop-in center for the homeless <ERROR>im</ERROR> new york : <ERROR>it</ERROR> you 're homeless , you <ERROR>du</ERROR> n't sleep for <ERROR>feare</ERROR> of being robbed or <ERROR>murderd</ERROR> . 
some of the homeless , obviously , had pre-existing mental illness or addiction . 
once <ERROR>thar</ERROR> , what ways of escape <ERROR>aree</ERROR> open to them other <ERROR>that</ERROR> drink , drugs or insanity ? 
you dismiss as sentimental the <ERROR>ve</ERROR> that the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs by <num> % might have played a <ERROR>significent</ERROR> role <ERROR>is</ERROR> the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the reagan-bush years . 
<ERROR>ore</ERROR> research stopped when a <ERROR>convienient</ERROR> assertion could be made .

<ERROR>tu</ERROR> department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so <ERROR>thatt</ERROR> safety <ERROR>wold</ERROR> be impaired ; its ability <ERROR>tow</ERROR> compete would <ERROR>bee</ERROR> sharply diminished ; it would <ERROR>bee</ERROR> put into foreign control ; <ERROR>are</ERROR> if <ERROR>they</ERROR> transaction would result in the <ERROR>sail</ERROR> of airline-related assets unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit .

that sounds neat , but this government any government propagandizes its own people every <ERROR>duy</ERROR> .

the first amendment proscribes the government from <ERROR>pasing</ERROR> laws abridging the right to <ERROR>fee</ERROR> speech , <ERROR>juge</ERROR> donald o'brien ruled . 
<ERROR>slow</ERROR> now the situation is this : 
i have a right to print those scripts if i go <ERROR>thise</ERROR> and laboriously <ERROR>dut</ERROR> no longer surreptitiously copy them out in <ERROR>log</ERROR> hand . 
<ERROR>i</ERROR> an era when <ERROR>evrey</ERROR> government agency has a public-relations machine that sends you stuff whether you <ERROR>whont</ERROR> it <ERROR>are</ERROR> not , this does seem odd .

section <num> also imposes unconstitutional conditions on <ERROR>t</ERROR> president 's ability to nominate candidates <ERROR>othe</ERROR> his <ERROR>chosing</ERROR> . 
the president could <ERROR>probley</ERROR> not avoid <ERROR>thhis</ERROR> restriction by choosing people <ERROR>welling</ERROR> to <ERROR>surve</ERROR> without pay , because <ERROR>i</ERROR> anti-deficiency act prohibits voluntary service to the government . 
muzzling provisions , <ERROR>withe</ERROR> might be called blindfold laws <ERROR>was</ERROR> well , <ERROR>pervent</ERROR> the executive branch <ERROR>fere</ERROR> even looking at <ERROR>cirtain</ERROR> policy options , <ERROR>lat</ERROR> alone from recommending <ERROR>the</ERROR> to <ERROR>cangress</ERROR> . 
typically , these laws seek to <ERROR>pervent</ERROR> executive <ERROR>brach</ERROR> officials from inquiring into whether certain <ERROR>fedral</ERROR> programs <ERROR>mank</ERROR> any <ERROR>ecomonica</ERROR> sense <ERROR>of</ERROR> proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations . 
there <ERROR>it</ERROR> something inherently suspect about congress 's prohibiting the executive from even <ERROR>studiing</ERROR> whether <ERROR>puplic</ERROR> funds are being wasted <ERROR>with</ERROR> some favored program or other . 
<ERROR>tish</ERROR> provision <ERROR>ammounts</ERROR> to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of <ERROR>t</ERROR> law , since a one-house resolution <ERROR>coud</ERROR> be said to <ERROR>bei</ERROR> duly adopted even though it would require neither bicameral action in <ERROR>cnongress</ERROR> nor presentation to the president for his <ERROR>sengher</ERROR> or veto . 
president bush <ERROR>choud</ERROR> veto appropriations <ERROR>acks</ERROR> that <ERROR>contane</ERROR> these kinds of unconstitutional conditions <ERROR>ons</ERROR> the president 's <ERROR>abillity</ERROR> to discharge <ERROR>is</ERROR> duties and exercise <ERROR>has</ERROR> prerogatives .

by <num> , then-speaker jim wright was discussing arms control <ERROR>if</ERROR> moscow with mikhail gorbachev and <ERROR>than</ERROR> attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the soviets as though <ERROR>i</ERROR> senate had ratified salt ii . 
the constitution does <ERROR>knot</ERROR> expressly give the <ERROR>presedent</ERROR> such power . 
the question <ERROR>as</ERROR> whether his only <ERROR>maenas</ERROR> of defense is the veto . 
as discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way <num> for the <ERROR>presedent</ERROR> to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable <ERROR>merly</ERROR> because <ERROR>thar</ERROR> conflict <ERROR>wint</ERROR> his <ERROR>pilicy</ERROR> objectives . 
one could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions <ERROR>with</ERROR> legislation that violate <ERROR>these</ERROR> separation of powers . 
<ERROR>is</ERROR> congress does nothing , president <ERROR>buch</ERROR> will have won . 
in <ERROR>thay</ERROR> case , he <ERROR>my</ERROR> receive an <ERROR>ap</ERROR> from the court that is a vindication of the <ERROR>presedent</ERROR> 's right to perform the duties <ERROR>a</ERROR> exercise <ERROR>thi</ERROR> prerogatives <num> the framers thought <num> should <ERROR>bee</ERROR> entrusted to the <ERROR>exectutive</ERROR> . 
but <ERROR>thee</ERROR> presidency would be no worse off than it is now . 
as it stands <ERROR>kn</ERROR> , <ERROR>comgress</ERROR> presumes after <ERROR>hte</ERROR> reagan administration <ERROR>than</ERROR> the white house will take unconstitutional <ERROR>provisons</ERROR> in appropriations bills lying down . 
if he does not , he will help realize madison 's fear in the federalist no. <num> of a legislature everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers <ERROR>intwo</ERROR> its impetuous vortex . 
his longer analysis of executive <ERROR>pour</ERROR> and the appropriations clause is to appear in the duke law journal later this year . 
<ERROR>my</ERROR> previous record was $ billion in <num> , according to the <ERROR>agraculture</ERROR> department . 
most <ERROR>onet</ERROR> those states set farm income records . 
what saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and <ERROR>uther</ERROR> crops <ERROR>than</ERROR> they had mortgaged <ERROR>th</ERROR> the <ERROR>grovment</ERROR> under price-support loan programs . 
<ERROR>with</ERROR> less parched areas , meanwhile , farmers who had <ERROR>lettel</ERROR> or no <ERROR>lose</ERROR> of <ERROR>productions</ERROR> profited greatly <ERROR>forma</ERROR> the higher prices . 
analysts attributed the increases partly <ERROR>tow</ERROR> the $ <num> billion disaster-assistance <ERROR>pakage</ERROR> enacted by <ERROR>converse</ERROR> . 
it also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies <ERROR>a</ERROR> many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the <num> farm program next year . 
at <ERROR>i</ERROR> same time , export demand for u.s. <ERROR>weat</ERROR> , <ERROR>cron</ERROR> and other commodities strengthened , said keith collins , a <ERROR>deportment</ERROR> analyst . 
all of <ERROR>tes</ERROR> forces came <ERROR>togearthy</ERROR> in <num> to <ERROR>benifit</ERROR> agriculture , mr. collins said . 
iowa and minnesota were among the few major <ERROR>from</ERROR> states <num> <ERROR>two</ERROR> log a decline in net cash income . 
many lost <ERROR>the</ERROR> farms . 
<ERROR>indead</ERROR> , net <ERROR>cach</ERROR> income is likely <ERROR>two</ERROR> fall <ERROR>tish</ERROR> year as <ERROR>form</ERROR> expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline . 
last year , government payments to farmers slipped <ERROR>of</ERROR> less than $ billion from <ERROR>the</ERROR> record $ billion in <num> . 
after years of struggling , the los angeles herald examiner will publish its last edition today , <ERROR>shud</ERROR> down <ERROR>buy</ERROR> its parent , hearst corp. , following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper .

the prospective buyers included investor marvin davis and the toronto sun . 
los angeles is a sprawling , balkanized <ERROR>newspapper</ERROR> market , and advertisers seemed to feel <num> they could buy <ERROR>spase</ERROR> in the mammoth times , <ERROR>them</ERROR> target a particular area with one of the regional dailies . 
further , the herald seemed torn editorially between keeping its old-time hearst readership blue-collar and sports-oriented and <ERROR>triing</ERROR> to <ERROR>provied</ERROR> a sprightly , upscale alternative to <ERROR>tehe</ERROR> sometimes staid <ERROR>time</ERROR> . 
the herald joins the baltimore news-american , <ERROR>wo</ERROR> folded , and the boston herald-american , which <ERROR>wase</ERROR> sold , as cornerstones of the old hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s . 
<ERROR>is</ERROR> fanciful offices were designed by architect julia morgan , who built the hearst castle at san simeon . 
analysts said <num> <ERROR>thee</ERROR> herald 's demise does n't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry .

<ERROR>hte</ERROR> herald 's sports coverage and arts criticism were <ERROR>alss</ERROR> highly regarded . 
hearst said <num> it would provide employees <ERROR>wive</ERROR> a placement service and pay <ERROR>there</ERROR> for <num> days .

many <ERROR>ato</ERROR> dealers <ERROR>noe</ERROR> let car buyers charge <ERROR>pard</ERROR> or all of their purchase on <ERROR>a</ERROR> american express card , but few card holders realize this , mr. riese says <num> . 
<ERROR>buts</ERROR> gmac approved the buick program , he says <num> , because <ERROR>i</ERROR> american express green card requires payment in full upon billing , and so does n't carry any finance rates . 
in addition , buick is a <ERROR>relativly</ERROR> respected nameplate among american express card holders , says <num> an american express spokeswoman . 
american express has more than <num> million <ERROR>cord</ERROR> holders <ERROR>if</ERROR> the u.s. , and <ERROR>ofer</ERROR> half have the <ERROR>gren</ERROR> card .

an appeal is expected . 
gilts , or british government bonds , which also fell sharply initially , retraced some of the losses to end <ERROR>adout</ERROR> point lower . 
at <ERROR>last</ERROR> point , hammersmith <ERROR>his</ERROR> reported to have accounted for as much as <num> % of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings . 
thus , an institution obligated <ERROR>too</ERROR> make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments . 
as interest rates rose , municipalities owed the banks more than <ERROR>tehe</ERROR> banks were <ERROR>paing</ERROR> them . 
the council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal . 
while this court ruling was only <ERROR>and</ERROR> hammersmith , it will obviously be very persuasive in <ERROR>othere</ERROR> cases <ERROR>othe</ERROR> a similar nature , a solicitor representing one of the banks <ERROR>ded</ERROR> . 
other financial institutions involved <ERROR>includ</ERROR> barclays bank plc , midland bank plc , security pacific corp. , chemical banking corp. 's chemical bank , citicorp 's citibank <ERROR>i</ERROR> mitsubishi finance international . 
banks could <ERROR>seak</ERROR> to recover payments <ERROR>two</ERROR> local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils .

<ERROR>tu</ERROR> target of their wrath ? 
since october 's minicrash , wall street has been shaken by <ERROR>a</ERROR> explosion of resentment <ERROR>agianst</ERROR> program trading , the computer-driven , lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks <ERROR>than</ERROR> futures that can <ERROR>sed</ERROR> stock prices reeling in <ERROR>muinets</ERROR> . 
the real <ERROR>battel</ERROR> is <ERROR>aver</ERROR> who will control that market <ERROR>are</ERROR> reap <ERROR>it</ERROR> huge rewards . 
<ERROR>th</ERROR> evidence indicates <ERROR>net</ERROR> program trading did n't , in fact , cause the market 's sharp <ERROR>fal</ERROR> on oct. <num> , though it may have exacerbated it . 
these are the main proponents <ERROR>afoh</ERROR> program trading . 
<ERROR>sol</ERROR> far , wall <ERROR>steest</ERROR> 's old guard seems <ERROR>of</ERROR> be winning <ERROR>thw</ERROR> program-trading battle , successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors . 
stung by charges that their greed <ERROR>as</ERROR> turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot , <ERROR>allmost</ERROR> all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage , <ERROR>the</ERROR> common form of program trading , for their <ERROR>owe</ERROR> accounts in the past few <ERROR>das</ERROR> . 
the old guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners <ERROR>hos</ERROR> been fierce <ERROR>so</ERROR> broad-based , in part because some old guard members feel <num> their very livelihood <ERROR>his</ERROR> at stake . 
big <ERROR>bord</ERROR> stock specialists , <ERROR>im</ERROR> a bold <ERROR>place</ERROR> revolt , began shortly after oct. <num> to telephone the corporate executives <ERROR>or</ERROR> the companies whose <ERROR>stark</ERROR> is listed <ERROR>of</ERROR> the <ERROR>bog</ERROR> board to <ERROR>haven</ERROR> them pressure the exchange <ERROR>th</ERROR> ban program trading . 
<ERROR>thaire</ERROR> said universally , <ERROR>whithout</ERROR> a single exception : <ERROR>dou</ERROR> n't <ERROR>event</ERROR> compromise . 
wall street 's new guard <ERROR>as</ERROR> n't <ERROR>likly</ERROR> to take <ERROR>at</ERROR> this lying down for long , however . 
program trading money managers <ERROR>fo</ERROR> gained control <ERROR>ofrer</ERROR> a big chunk of the invested funds in this <ERROR>coontry</ERROR> , and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded <ERROR>tham</ERROR> to the <ERROR>abilaty</ERROR> to move rapidly in <ERROR>ane</ERROR> out the market that program trading gives them . 
even some members of <ERROR>these</ERROR> old guard , despite their current advantage , seem to be conceding that <ERROR>tehe</ERROR> future belongs with the new <ERROR>gaurd</ERROR> . 
<ERROR>here</ERROR> sold his exchange seat and wrote <ERROR>and</ERROR> bitter letter to big board chairman john j. phelan jr. in which he said <num> the big board <ERROR>in</ERROR> too focused on machines , rather than people . 
<ERROR>a</ERROR> do not want my money invested in what i <ERROR>consiter</ERROR> as nothing more than a casino , mr. bradley wrote . 
at kidder , a unit of general electric co. , <ERROR>anf</ERROR> other big brokerage firms , stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away . 
the <ERROR>dig</ERROR> board the nation 's premier <ERROR>stark</ERROR> exchange is sharply divided between its <ERROR>flor</ERROR> traders <ERROR>are</ERROR> its <ERROR>tap</ERROR> executives .

critics like mr. murray <ERROR>or</ERROR> looking for witches , and people <ERROR>hoow</ERROR> use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman , <ERROR>ses</ERROR> <num> j. thomas allen , president <ERROR>ofr</ERROR> advanced investment management inc. , a <ERROR>pittsburg</ERROR> firm that runs <ERROR>are</ERROR> $ <num> million fund that uses index arbitrage . 
for <ERROR>at</ERROR> the furor , there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage , the most controversial type <ERROR>from</ERROR> computer-assisted program trading . 
that divergence is what stock index traders <ERROR>seak</ERROR> .

we have to <ERROR>naf</ERROR> a <ERROR>sysem</ERROR> that says <ERROR>two</ERROR> those largest investors : 
you will not panic , 
but the prospects for legislation <ERROR>hat</ERROR> targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon . 
<ERROR>a</ERROR> big board 's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions , but a total ban is n't being considered , big <ERROR>bord</ERROR> officials <ERROR>said</ERROR> <num> . 
program trading is <ERROR>hair</ERROR> to stay , and computers are here to stay , and <ERROR>wee</ERROR> just need to understand <ERROR>is</ERROR> .

program trading critics also want the <ERROR>fedral</ERROR> reserve board , rather <ERROR>then</ERROR> the futures industry , to set such margins . 
higher margins would chase <ERROR>awart</ERROR> dozens of smaller traders who <ERROR>hlp</ERROR> larger traders buy and <ERROR>selle</ERROR> , they <ERROR>said</ERROR> .

index arbitrage is <ERROR>are</ERROR> common form of program trading . 
in index arbitrage , <ERROR>tie</ERROR> widget is the s&p <num> , and its <ERROR>prise</ERROR> is constantly compared between the futures market in chicago and the stock markets <ERROR>largly</ERROR> in <ERROR>now</ERROR> york . 
if the <ERROR>mooey</ERROR> manager performing this service <ERROR>his</ERROR> being paid by <ERROR>he</ERROR> clients to match <ERROR>awer</ERROR> beat the return of the s&p <num> index , he is likely to remain fully invested <ERROR>a</ERROR> all times . 
by constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget , index-arbitrage traders <ERROR>hop</ERROR> to <ERROR>ade</ERROR> between <num> % and <num> % <ERROR>of</ERROR> the annual return of <ERROR>tie</ERROR> s&p <num> . 
the <ERROR>fackt</ERROR> that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers <ERROR>fale</ERROR> to beat the s&p <num> may contribute to <ERROR>my</ERROR> hysteria surrounding the issue . 
the current opportunities arise because <ERROR>i</ERROR> process for executing <ERROR>i</ERROR> buy or sell order in the actual stocks <ERROR>thet</ERROR> make up the s&p <num> is <ERROR>mor</ERROR> cumbersome <ERROR>that</ERROR> transacting in the futures market . 
so <ERROR>is</ERROR> index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies <ERROR>betwen</ERROR> two markets for the same widget , how did program trading evolve <ERROR>in</ERROR> the evil creature that is evoking the curses <ERROR>from</ERROR> so many observers ? 
<ERROR>bun</ERROR> many of these reforms are unneeded , even harmful . 
an index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless <ERROR>they</ERROR> is <ERROR>serfisemete</ERROR> difference between the markets <ERROR>i</ERROR> new york and chicago <num> to <ERROR>cuver</ERROR> all transaction costs . 
think about what causes <ERROR>tehe</ERROR> difference in prices between the two markets for s&p <num> stocks usually it is large investors initiating <ERROR>the</ERROR> buy <ERROR>all</ERROR> sell in chicago .

why does <ERROR>thhis</ERROR> large hypothetical seller trade in chicago instead of new york ? 
in a competitive market , this investor has <ERROR>mony</ERROR> ways <num> to execute his <ERROR>trasactions</ERROR> , and he <ERROR>wiil</ERROR> have more alternatives -lrb- both foreign and domestic -rrb- if his volume is profitable <num> for an exchange to handle . 
volatility surrounding his trades occurs not <ERROR>becus</ERROR> of index arbitrage , but because <ERROR>hes</ERROR> is <ERROR>as</ERROR> large <ERROR>additon</ERROR> or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity . 
the speed of his transaction is n't to be feared either , because faster and cleaner execution is <ERROR>desireable</ERROR> , not loathsome . 
encouraging long-term investing . 
policies designed to encourage <ERROR>ond</ERROR> type <ERROR>ovoe</ERROR> investor <ERROR>aver</ERROR> another <ERROR>vea</ERROR> akin to placing a <ERROR>eign</ERROR> over the big board 's door <ERROR>sieding</ERROR> : buyers welcome , sellers please go away ! 
a <ERROR>fre</ERROR> market with a <ERROR>proffit</ERROR> motive will attract each investor to <ERROR>an</ERROR> liquidity and risks <num> he can tolerate . 
periods before <ERROR>th</ERROR> advent <ERROR>off</ERROR> futures or program trading <ERROR>wear</ERROR> often <ERROR>mor</ERROR> volatile , usually <ERROR>wane</ERROR> fundamental market <ERROR>condeson</ERROR> were undergoing change -lrb- , , <ERROR>a</ERROR> for example -rrb- . 
could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks , <ERROR>insted</ERROR> of <ERROR>hte</ERROR> evil deeds <ERROR>ovoe</ERROR> program-trading goblins ? 
in <ERROR>useing</ERROR> program trading as a whipping boy , fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors <ERROR>foir</ERROR> their existing stock-selection products . 
how does <ERROR>i</ERROR> nice <ERROR>noor</ERROR> tax , say <num> % , <ERROR>onn</ERROR> any financial transaction sound ?

<ERROR>a</ERROR> loudest of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors . 
<ERROR>eaven</ERROR> with mutual funds , <ERROR>tehe</ERROR> little investor continues to tolerate <ERROR>hey</ERROR> fees , high commissions <ERROR>so</ERROR> poor performance , while index-fund managers slowly amass a better record with <ERROR>louer</ERROR> fees , lower commissions and less <ERROR>resk</ERROR> . 
almost all new regulation <ERROR>it</ERROR> introduced in the interests <ERROR>ovot</ERROR> protecting the little guy , and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences . 
<ERROR>they</ERROR> sad reality is <ERROR>tat</ERROR> the retail investor continues <ERROR>tow</ERROR> pursue stellar performers <ERROR>ferst</ERROR> , while leaving institutions to grapple with basis points <ERROR>ovoe</ERROR> performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter .

the reason : risks <ERROR>fam</ERROR> the firms ' <ERROR>mew</ERROR> merchant banking activities are rising as <ERROR>revinue</ERROR> from the industry 's traditional <ERROR>buisness</ERROR> erodes . 
<ERROR>wheth</ERROR> the shudders <ERROR>ceme</ERROR> the realization that some of wall <ERROR>sreet</ERROR> 's biggest players are struggling to <ERROR>mantain</ERROR> the stellar credit standing required to finance <ERROR>ther</ERROR> activities profitably . 
the <ERROR>bigest</ERROR> firms still retain <ERROR>to</ERROR> highest ratings <ERROR>ons</ERROR> their commercial paper . 
shearson is 62%-owned by <ERROR>ameracan</ERROR> express <ERROR>comp</ERROR> . 
<ERROR>ah</ERROR> sweeping restructuring <ERROR>for</ERROR> the industry is possible . 
<ERROR>woht</ERROR> worries credit-rating concerns the most is that wall street firms <ERROR>ur</ERROR> taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk <ERROR>bound</ERROR> financings . 
whereas conventional securities financings are structured to <ERROR>d</ERROR> sold quickly , wall street 's <ERROR>neu</ERROR> penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is <ERROR>reulting</ERROR> in long-term lending commitments <ERROR>but</ERROR> stretch out for <ERROR>muns</ERROR> or years . 
<ERROR>woll</ERROR> street is facing <ERROR>the</ERROR> catch-22 <ERROR>situating</ERROR> , says mr. mahoney of moody 's . 
in addition , he says , the buy-out business is under pressure <ERROR>bacmines</ERROR> of the junk bond collapse , meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks . 
in a recent report , moody 's said <num> <ERROR>is</ERROR> expects intense competition <ERROR>the</ERROR> occur through <ERROR>tu</ERROR> rest of <ERROR>tu</ERROR> century in the securities industry , which , combined with overcapacity , will create poor prospects for profitability . 
<ERROR>buth</ERROR> moody 's and s&p cited first boston 's reliance in <ERROR>resent</ERROR> years on merchant banking , <ERROR>whihc</ERROR> has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely <ERROR>hald</ERROR> firm 's profit . 
<ERROR>if</ERROR> addition , <ERROR>as</ERROR> big loan that <ERROR>firt</ERROR> boston made to ohio mattress co . was n't repaid on <ERROR>tame</ERROR> when <ERROR>is</ERROR> $ <num> million junk financing for a buy-out <ERROR>or</ERROR> the bedding <ERROR>compy</ERROR> was withdrawn . 
total merchant banking exposures are <ERROR>i</ERROR> excess of the firm 's equity . 
shearson also has been <ERROR>on</ERROR> aggressive participant <ERROR>is</ERROR> the leveraged buy-out business . 
in <ERROR>additon</ERROR> , shearson 's listed $ <num> billion of capital is overstated , according <ERROR>too</ERROR> the rating concerns , because <ERROR>its</ERROR> includes $ billion of goodwill . 
a shearson spokesman said <num> the firm is n't worried . 
after two months of talks , our <ERROR>raking</ERROR> was maintained . 
the collapse of junk bond prices <ERROR>so</ERROR> the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently <ERROR>having</ERROR> taken their toll on <ERROR>closly</ERROR> held drexel , the leading underwriter <ERROR>with</ERROR> that market . 
drexel this year eliminated <ERROR>is</ERROR> retail or individual customer business , cutting the <ERROR>fern</ERROR> 's workforce almost <ERROR>if</ERROR> half <ERROR>th</ERROR> just over . 
the firm 's capital , moreover , has n't grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say <num> . 
we 're <ERROR>wall</ERROR> positioned with $ billion <ERROR>from</ERROR> capital , a drexel spokesman said <num> . 
moreover , we 've probably been <ERROR>tie</ERROR> most aggressive firm <ERROR>of</ERROR> the street in reducing costs , which are down around <num> % over the last six <ERROR>moths</ERROR> . 
most recently , mr. veraldi , <num> <ERROR>yers</ERROR> old , has been <ERROR>vise</ERROR> president <ERROR>ovot</ERROR> product <ERROR>ane</ERROR> manufacturing engineering at ford motor <ERROR>com</ERROR> . 
under the so-called team taurus approach , mr. veraldi and other ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers , assembly-line <ERROR>work</ERROR> , auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development <ERROR>cylcl</ERROR> . 
it was later <ERROR>appled</ERROR> to <ERROR>hiver</ERROR> new-car programs , including those that produced the ford thunderbird and mercury cougar .

we can understand and share <ERROR>to</ERROR> compassion that <ERROR>maks</ERROR> judges <ERROR>somtimes</ERROR> wish to offer a kind of solomonic aid to those who 've <ERROR>beee</ERROR> hurt . 
too often now , a single court <ERROR>decission</ERROR> becomes the precedent for <ERROR>athor</ERROR> , less compelling cases . 
the drug was approved by the <ERROR>foor</ERROR> and drug administration and marketed by <ERROR>so</ERROR> <num> pharmaceutical companies , <ERROR>odern</ERROR> under generic labels . 
the cases <ERROR>quickley</ERROR> went <ERROR>ro</ERROR> court , <ERROR>dut</ERROR> the mothers of several thousand des plaintiffs could n't recall <ERROR>whos</ERROR> brand <ERROR>their</ERROR> used . 
courts made the assumption that <ERROR>at</ERROR> des pills were <ERROR>esentially</ERROR> the <ERROR>sane</ERROR> , and created a market-share test <ERROR>sow</ERROR> that damages would be assessed against drug makers <ERROR>with</ERROR> the proportion <ERROR>ov</ERROR> their share of <ERROR>tie</ERROR> original sales . 
drug makers should n't be able to duck liability <ERROR>becaise</ERROR> people could n't identify precisely which identical drug <ERROR>wus</ERROR> used . 
just as all plaintiffs are not alike , <ERROR>is</ERROR> turns out that des defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties . 
but as duke university <ERROR>lor</ERROR> professor william van alstyne notes , by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable <ERROR>i</ERROR> new york for a bad <ERROR>abuol</ERROR> even if he sold all his <ERROR>appls</ERROR> in california .

plans to <ERROR>dom</ERROR> this are due <ERROR>too</ERROR> be filed in <ERROR>and</ERROR> week or so . 
that 's why columbia just wrote <ERROR>of</ERROR> $ <num> million <ERROR>othe</ERROR> its junk and reserved $ <num> million <ERROR>fre</ERROR> future junk losses . 
columbia , a longtime drexel client , wo n't provide current <ERROR>datter</ERROR> on <ERROR>is</ERROR> junk . 
<ERROR>tes</ERROR> were allied stores , <ERROR>westen</ERROR> union telegraph , gillett holdings , sci television and texas <ERROR>are</ERROR> , <ERROR>through</ERROR> many other bonds in columbia 's portfolio <ERROR>aslo</ERROR> have lost value . 
it also hopes for <ERROR>ultimatel</ERROR> gains of as much as $ <num> million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings . 
but columbia 's good bank would be a regulated thrift , while the <ERROR>bed</ERROR> bank would be a private investment company , holding some <ERROR>cift</ERROR> columbia 's junk bonds , real <ERROR>astate</ERROR> and equity investments . 
the thrift surely could be sold for more than <ERROR>thi</ERROR> value <ERROR>from</ERROR> its equity , <ERROR>fina</ERROR> industry executives say <num> . 
it is n't clear how much a restructuring would <ERROR>held</ERROR> columbia stockholders . 
you <ERROR>sall</ERROR> the good bank as an ongoing operation and use <ERROR>so</ERROR> of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank , says thrift specialist lewis ranieri of ranieri associates in new york . 
<ERROR>fw</ERROR> people think <num> mr. spiegel <ERROR>wantes</ERROR> to run a bread-and-butter thrift , which <ERROR>curent</ERROR> rules would force columbia to become . 
<ERROR>afoh</ERROR> course , regulators would <ERROR>hav</ERROR> to approve columbia 's reorganization .
